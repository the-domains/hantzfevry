Hantz Fevry Associate at Google | Entrepreneur | Fintech | Founder at I.Trade International Edit postView stats Mobile Ready? Aug 17, 2015791 views106 Likes6 CommentsShare on LinkedInShare on FacebookShare on Twitter Mobile technology has made tremendous progress since its inception in the 90s. Since the introduction of the mobile phone, not only has the device changed dramatically in its features, but so has our behaviour in the adoption of this new technology.  There is no doubt that our relationship with mobile technology has evolved to a point where it is now an integral part of our daily lives. Globally, the demand for such technology has reached a new level where almost every individual possesses a smartphone or at least some form of mobile device to satisfy their communication needs. There is indeed a paradigm shift in businesses around the globe to reinvent themselves and be available 24/7, at the fingertips of the consumer. This communication Renaissance has given rise to new ways of conducting business where transactions can now be processed via new means called Mobile Commerce known as M-commerce. Mobile Commerce The most important question large and small corporations are asking themselves today is, how do we get on board with M-Commerce? Businesses know that they are reliant solely on the consumers, and if the consumers are ready to move onto the mobile platform, then it's time for them to make the switch. According to a research made by Adobe:                                                       59% of U.S. smartphone owners have used their   devices to research an item before purchasing it, compared to 65% for tablet owners. 80% of mobile users' purchasing decisions are influenced by the mobile channel, even though they may not use their devices to complete the final purchase.                                                                                                                     These points illustrate clearly that consumers today are tech savvy, and they want quick answers to make quicker decisions. Therefore, in most cases they are ready to initiate transactions online. The Trendsetters... Amazon is a company who took advantage of M-Commerce and reaped large profits and popularity.     This company is regarded as one of the earliest players in online shopping. In the early 2000s, they licensed the "1-Click ordering" to Apple for their online store and they later introduced their Amazon app with the same feature. The mass appeal of the app was it's reliability and convenience.  Not surprisingly, about a decade later, Amazon became well known for online purchases, and by the end of the last quarter in 2013, 73% of U.S. mobile Internet subscribers, used the Amazon app or browsed the site. Existing large corporations and several new businesses alike became very successful by challenging the status quo and making some services available strictly through mobile. One of the most recent example is Uber. Uber not only shaped the way the traditional taxi system works, but included a whole new science behind the scene. With just one click, its app connects drivers with customers based on a mapping and pricing algorithm that delivers rides that are often cheaper than metered taxis. Uber's app also made the payment system simpler, by cutting out cash and credit card payments altogether. Alternatively, they streamlined the entire process, from ordering the taxi to making the payment, in one simple step. Available in 58 countries, Uber took a full advantage of the mobile technology by making an otherwise lengthy process into a simple click of a button. Mobile Banking Several Financial institutions across the globe are shifting to mobile based platform as opposed to traditional branch or website systems. It is now inevitable that major banks around the world shift towards Mobile Banking. If banks today fail to recognize this trend, it will make them vulnerable and at risk of being out of touch with their customers. Several companies that are known to be innovators in our society are now leading the way and making full use of this trend. For instance, Apple and Android have included NFC (near field communication) modes in their smartphones to facilitate the process of making payments in real time using their phones without the use of bank or credit cards. Juniper Research estimates that by the end of the year (2015), NFC mobile payments will cover $74 billion worth of transactions. This represents three times the size of the NFC payments made last year by using smartphones. This is definitely one of the fastest growing segments in the mobile transaction industry. Apple Pay -- Allows you to make transactions with your iPhone 6, Apple Watch or iPad with a touch of a screen. The popularity of Apple Pay is soaring, making it easier for consumers to make contactless purchases. Mobile Ads This year, it is estimated that over 2 billion people are using smartphones. Stats show an interesting trend where nearly two thirds of Americans use smartphones which represents a lot of potential consumers for various businesses. This one fact makes it impossible for advertising firms to ignore the power and influence of mobile technology. An increasingly large number of businesses are targeting potential clients base through mobile base. One fast food company which really took advantage of mobile advertising to boost their sales is Taco Bell. This fast food giant not only used mobile advertising to promote its products, but also used it to successfully launch its "Happier Hour" campaign. Other companies like Yamaha chose mobile advertising to attract mid-range buyers for their FZ-16 motorcycle. When customers click their ad, they can view a full length commercial and also read reviews from those who have already purchased the bike. In a recent survey conducted by AT&T it was revealed that 95% of the successful small businesses in the American industry use mobile advertising to boost their revenues, resulting in earnings of about $65 billion a year. Stats collected by AT&T reveal that those small businesses using mobile technology succeed in saving 150 hours each year. Small Businesses Need to Join the Mobile Trend Mobile commerce is not just a trend that will disappear in a few years. Consumers today want everything to be fast, simple and easy and this is what  mobile commerce embodies.   Businesses exist in a dynamic environment that change rapidly with taste, demographics, political environment and technological advancement. There are various instances in history where companies who failed to embrace technological change were left behind by companies willing to make the necessary shift in perspective. With the examples of Kodak and Motorola, where both companies were technology giants of their time, but due to the failure to adapt to the latest advancement lost most of their customer base.     In conclusion, if we see what happened to corporations who refused to adapt to newer technology, and compare them with those that were first to jump on the bandwagon, the answer is simple, Mobile Technology Is The Future Of Business.
